Born and raised in Colorado, USA, I grew up hiking and exploring in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and Foothills. After receiving my B.A. in Geography and Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, I decided to continue my education at the University of Colorado Boulder. Here, I am a PhD candidate in Civil Engineering, in the Hydrology, Fluid Mechanics, and Water Resources program. I focus my studies on understanding the complex relationships between hydrology and glacial dynamics, specifically for surging glaciers.
